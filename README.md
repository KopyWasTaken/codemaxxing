# Codemaxxing

This is the personal project / repo create to make myself a better programmer.

It uses AI and skills to create interview problems for me to solve to upgrade my manual coding proficiency.

Skills that the AI can use can be found in the `ai_skills` folder.

Each problem can be found in its own directory within the `exercises` folder.

Each problem is a directory that contains:

- The problem to be solved in README.md, along with any instructions to get the code in the directory working (such as installing languages, initializing environments, installing dependencies, etc.)
- The file that will hold the hand-written solution, called solution.file_ext, where file_ext is the extension for the programming language being used.
- The file that will run the solution and test that it works as expected, called test.file_ext, where ext is the extension for the programming language being used.
